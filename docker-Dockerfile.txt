In a Dockerfile, the command at the end that starts the application is:
...
...
CMD ["mysqld"]

A valid CMD in Dockerfile:
eg. CMD command param1
CMD sleep 5
eg. CMD ["command", "param1"]
CMD ["sleep", "5"]

In a Dockerfile, a command can be appended by using ENTRYPOINT:

FROM Ubuntu
...
ENTRYPOINT ["sleep"]
...
CMD ["5"]

If there is a need to set a different entrypoint at runtime:
$ docker run --entrypoint sleep2.0 ubuntu-sleeper 10

Run an instance of the ubuntu image to run the sleep 1000 command at startup. Run it in detached mode.
$ docker run -d --entrypoint sleep ubuntu 1000
